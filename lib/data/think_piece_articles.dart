To become a proficient member of the team I felt like it was necessary to relearn how to create basic data structures and algorithms. I still understood them all conceptually, but had practiced in Javascript, so I wasn't familiar with Java's built in data structures and often had to rely on Googling. Of course Googling is an inherent part of the job, but what I wanted to accomplish was gain some \"conversational fluency\" in the language, where I would no longer second guess myself on syntax. Day to day job responsibilities don't usually require large data structures, but I also wanted to be more aware of simple elegant solutions to common problems and improve my code literacy in general for code reviews."),

Now I'm happy to say that I've made it through most of the year, and have completed the 300 days required to get the 2023-year achievement on Leetcode.

I found creating smaller monthly challenges like this were very productive, and helped a lot to break up the tedium of just doing random problems.

So many of the complicated mechanics of each set are represented in tokens. They're used on the camera highlighted games of official matches, but where they're most important is right at home on the kitchen table. Plus, they're beautiful and customizable and can give a whole new feel to your deck. However, impromptu creation of tokens can dramatically increase the Execution time and stall play.

I think EDH has created a very toxic design pattern in Magic the Gathering, where more and more creatures are being designed as legendaries simply to create a greater the market of EDH players. With the pool of potential commanders being flooded as it is, it has greatly watered down the restriction of using a legendary creature. Therefore I want to open the floodgates to more varied and wild interpretations of decks. Rather than pick a character to represent a deck, pick a favorite spell that really appeals to you and however you want to play the game.

Usually all it takes is pulling out the tutors, fetches, sol rings, and trimming down a few cards. It's been a lot of fun, and we've seen consistently high powered interactive games where everyone was involved but able to play at a faster clip.
