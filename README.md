# tyro_work
my portfolio website 2.0, created in flutter


## Work That's Further off
set up favicons and splash

get image in the right resolution for web

make a link to my resume
-- can your resume just take up a whole screen? with a download and share link? ooh that'd be tight

## Getting Started To Do
figure out tiled background image
-- have content go over it. Stack? with that and the rest of the content in a column?
-> then figure out randomization of image to different stored assets.

set up light and dark themes
see if the scaffold body theme color applies to all containers in that color? if so that would be great
see if the color in the theme can be based off getting from the localstorage ?? dark

associate light/dark & fonts with switches
need to import that local storage package

see how to install a custom font, I'm pretty sure I had one as an asset in the other project so look up how I did that
