my portfolio website 2.0, created in flutter


## Work That's Further off

get image in the right resolution for web

make a link to my resume
-- can your resume just take up a whole screen? with a download and share link? ooh that'd be tight

figure out how to rotate text.
-- what angle? 

maybe add an animation on all the main screen stuff so that it comes in one at a time and you see the background for a sec?
figure out how to do that squarespace fadein animation after scrolling to certain points
maybe set a variable trigger on a scroll controller when reaching+being within certain values
maybe pay for that animation class video

thought pieces - grill guide

## Getting Started To Do
done - import image assets
done - set up favicon 
done - figure out tiled background image
done - -- have content go over it. Stack? with that and the rest of the content in a column?
done - set up splash
done - figure out randomization of image to different stored assets.


set up theme data
set up light and dark themes
see if the scaffold body theme color applies to all containers in that color? if so that would be great
see if the color in the theme can be based off getting from the localstorage ?? dark
decide if app bar should be blue or in the light/dark color
-- light dark might look nice with some transparency

decide if things should come up from below scrolling upwards (with like a card to cover the corners) 

associate light/dark & fonts with switches
need to import that local storage package

see how to install a custom font, I'm pretty sure I had one as an asset in the other project so look up how I did that

Work With Tyro
-> scroll down
image comes up with "the rockstar developer you've been looking for"
-> scroll down
card comes up with projects
-- projects are in horizontal tiles just showing the image and then those scroll down
// maybe scrolls could be lengthed by deviceheight, every time you scroll a device height you go to a new section

project tiled images
-- is there a way to make sure that it can crop or expand to be responsive?
* equidistant
* procrastination buster
* tyrowo inked
project tiles animated expand to show description of the project, link to where it's published
maybe if the project tiles have a less transparent or even opaque version of the card color it'll make a nice gradient.

upload inspo images in a folder to be collected with the rest of the repo for posterity? or at least reference images
